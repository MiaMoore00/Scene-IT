Scene It App


Objective

Now that we’ve got a good general understanding of  how we can render data to the DOM, we’re going to take a stab at building a practical application, worthy of a spot in our portfolios!


The app is called Scene It (lol, get it? Like a movie “scene”? #sorrynotsorry). It’s a simple tool for searching for movies, flagging ones you want to watch, and later giving them a thumbs up or thumbs down after you watch them. The finished product will use AJAX to make requests to an external API called OMDB.
